## 🎯 About Us and Our Goal

This project was made by three college students as their Honors Capstone project and a culmination of their full stack development skills. We all went through the grueling process that is job finding and never found any tool or website that made the process easier. This was our main motivation in creating JobDPS and hope the tool can help our peers, whether fresh graduates or a seasoned professional, make job finding easier.
